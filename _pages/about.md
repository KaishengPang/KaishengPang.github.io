I am a junior undergraduate student at [the School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University](https://www.ise.sdu.edu.cn/). Currently, I am honored to be an undergraduate research intern, supervised primarily by [**Prof. Runmin Cong**](https://rmcong.github.io/) in the [Multimedia and Vision Processing Group](https://rmcong.github.io/MVPLab.html). Additionally, I have received meticulous guidance from [**Assoc. Prof. Feng Li**](https://lifengcs.github.io/).
My research interests lie in **Computer Vision (CV)**.
